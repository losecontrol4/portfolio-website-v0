# portfolio-website-v0

This is my first draft of my portfolio website. The primary goal is function, and it is planned to be simple and hopefully it is intuitive. At the time of writing this, my front end knowledge is still in a place I would call beginner slowly seeping into intermediate. Therefore, I'm not trying to show off quite yet (though I have some awesome arcade themed concepts I plan to implement in a later draft as my knowledge of front end tools evolves.)
