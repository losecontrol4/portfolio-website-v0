Hi, I’m Adam! I am a 23 year old computer scientist and musician
currently searching for my start in the software engineering field. I
find purpose through creating. From creation through video games 
to writing stories to composing music to developing
software– there's beauty in being proud of something you made and
saying, “Look, I did that!” Stephen
Sondheim’s lyric explains this feeling: “Look, I made a hat, where there
never was a hat.” That lyric is from Sunday in the Park with George, a musical about George Seurat- the artist who lead
the pointillism movement. Pointillism is about the tiny points coming
together to show a bigger picture. This idea extends far beyond
paintings. For compositions, those points are pulled from each vibration
added together and interpreted over time to give us an experience. For
computer science, there are many “points” we can draw from, whether it
be each team members contribution, each function being strung together, or the state of the computer’s
data memory and instruction memory at each given clock cycle-
All the points come together to make the whole. And yes, my bio did
become a pointillism discussion- but I think it reflects on who I am as
a creator. I love to create and I love to see every dot of the work come
together.
